Hello!\
This probably my last post here. For today I'm not planning to do anything more
with Food Picker. I'm gonna leave it as it is now. But don't worry. It looks
now a lot better than before. You can check it here

I know, I'm not proffesional designer, but in my opinion it looks acceptable
now. What's more, now amout of meals is over 20. You can find demo
[here](https://themealseeker.web.app).

And few words about blogging. I'm glad I tried it but... I don't feel good and
comfortable with it. I prefer to learn by myself and move forward. In the
beggining it was very exciting for me, I liked it, I was checking whole posts
many times before publishing but after some time I got a bit bored with it. I
will still learn learn React and in the future surely other technologies. So
for the last time. Thanks for reading! :)

Have a good day/evening! ;D
