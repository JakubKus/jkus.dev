Hello!\
This is my the first blog I've ever done. I will be describing my journey of
learning React. I've heard that managing blog is very useful and helpful for
programmers and that every should at least try it. So that's I am here for :)

I find React really cool because adding new features to app is simplier than in
Angular especially in newer versions of it after AngularJS. It's also better
for developing small apps and I want to start with those rather than with big
complex systems. I also want to practise my english here so please don't punish
me for my mistakes too hard ;)

Have a good day/evening! :D
