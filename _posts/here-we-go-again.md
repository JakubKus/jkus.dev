Hello!\
Long time no see. Well, exactly two years :D. A lot has changed since that day.
I'm not a frontend developer wannabe anymore, because I became a real frontend
developer ðŸ˜Ž.

I decided to give blogging one more chance, but this time I will not stick to
posting once a week. It was probably a main reason why I stopped it. It was
just unnecessary promise I made myself.

I'm going to post here things and cool libs from frontend world which I learned
or discovered. I have also switched to Linux recently so I can share my tricks
with you which help me in my everyday work ;)

So that's it for today. Thanks for reading!
