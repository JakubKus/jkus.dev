          and I contantly try to improve my skills. I do this by:

          I started my career as a <b>frontend developer</b>, but after 3 years I decided to switch my path to a{' '}
          <b>fullstack developer</b>. I&apos;m aware it would be easier to just specialize in a single thing and become
          solid expert in it, but it&apos;s just not the way for me. I like to build things and I try to not limit
          myself by being specialized in only one thing. <b>Fullstack approach</b> allows me to do everything I want and
          gives me more fun.

        <p>
          I&apos;m also interested in business related stuff - I&apos;d like to launch own online product one day.
          Besides that, I observe crypto and traditional stock world.
