Hello!\
It's time to write an update post :) I'm getting more and more familiar with
React. I understand it a bit more now than last Friday but I still have much to
learn. Going to my app I had to change a little its way of working.

It was enough to simply change colors of buttons on click, but I realised that
every button has its own "state" and it's not okay if I want to do with them
something more. What I've done is that I added a new class and the previous
class just calls it. With that fact, all buttons had common states and that was
the thing I needed. What my app does now is if I select 1 or more answers, some
of 4 currently added meals show off, e.g If I select 200 - 500 calories / 100g,
sweet flavor and medium difficulty level I will get "Cheesecake" and
"Pancakes", everything in real-time :)

Now the thing I think I should focus on is to optimize it and maybe try to do
it in other way because I think it can be done better and cleaner.

By the way few hints gave me popular and respected programmer and chess player
[Andrzej Krzywda](https://twitter.com/andrzejkrzywda), thank you and best
regards :D I also added my whole code from this project to
[Github](https://github.com/JakubKus/meal-seeker) so you can check everything
I did to make it work. That's all I did, I'm really happy it's already doing
something :) Maybe it's not beautiful and it doesn't have many
features but it's all ahead of me. Thank you for reading :)

Have a good day/evening! :D
