Hi!\
This time I decided, I will try to deploy my app. In the past I deployed my
another app to Heroku, so it wasn't my first time. I thought it will be hard
and complicated because it's React app but actually it was quick and simple.
Here are steps I followed to get deployed app

- First of all I found
  [this tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages). Every step is
  described very fine there.
- I could skip first 2 steps, because I already had project on GitHub and on my
  pc. So I moved to step 3 and installed "gh-pages" DevDependecy
- After that I added "homepage" property into my package.json and 2 scripts to
  scripts section:

```jsx
"homepage": "http://jakubkus.github.io/Food-Picker",
```

```jsx
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
```

- 5th step I could skip either
- 6th step was the first problem I had with deployment but I fixed it very
  fast. I thought if my local repository is connected to remote one, then I don't
  have to do anything in this step. But the problem was that I named my
  connection "gh" and I had to add another with original name "origin". After
  that it worked perfectly.
- Finally the last thing left to do was to use 1 command "npm run deploy". It
  made production version of my app and pushed it to new branch "gh-pages". On my
  project's GitHub in settings I had to enable GitHub Pages and choose branch and
  my project was actually published!
